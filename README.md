pytask is a workflow management system that facilitates reproducible data analyses. Its
features include:

- **Automatic discovery of tasks.**
- **Lazy evaluation.** If a task, its dependencies, and its products have not changed,
  do not execute it.
- **Debug mode.**
  [Jump into the debugger](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/debugging.html)
  if a task fails, get feedback quickly, and be more productive.
- **Repeat a task with different inputs.**
  [Loop over task functions](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/repeating_tasks_with_different_inputs.html)
  to run the same task with different inputs.
- **Select tasks via expressions.** Run only a subset of tasks with
  [expressions and marker expressions](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/selecting_tasks.html).
- **Easily extensible with plugins**. pytask is built on top of
  [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a plugin management framework,
  which allows you to adjust pytask to your needs. Plugins are available for
  [parallelization](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-parallel),
  [LaTeX](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex),
  [R](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r), and
  [Stata](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata) and more can be found
  [here](https://github.com/topics/pytask). Learn more about plugins in
  [this tutorial](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/plugins.html).

# Installation

<!-- Keep in sync with docs/source/tutorials/installation.md -->

pytask is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytask) and on
[Anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytask). Install the package with

```console
$ pip install pytask
```

or

```console
$ conda install -c conda-forge pytask
```

Color support is automatically available on non-Windows platforms. On Windows, please,
use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) which can be, for example,
installed via the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal).

To quickly set up a new project, use the
[cookiecutter-pytask-project](https://github.com/pytask-dev/cookiecutter-pytask-project)
template or start from
[other templates or example projects](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_guides/bp_templates_and_projects.html).

# Usage

A task is a function that is detected if the module and the function name are prefixed
with `task_`. Here is an example.

```python
# Content of task_hello.py.

import pytask


@pytask.mark.produces("hello_earth.txt")
def task_hello_earth(produces):
    produces.write_text("Hello, earth!")
```

Here are some details:

- Dependencies and products of a task are tracked via markers. Use
  `@pytask.mark.depends_on` for dependencies and `@pytask.mark.produces` for products.
  Values are strings or `pathlib.Path` and point to files on the disk.
- Use `produces` (and `depends_on`) as function arguments to access the paths inside the
  function. pytask converts all paths to `pathlib.Path`'s. Here, `produces` holds the
  path to `"hello_earth.txt"`.

To execute the task, enter `pytask` on the command-line

# Acknowledgment

The license also includes a copyright and permission notice from
[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) since some modules, classes, and
functions are copied from pytest. Not to mention how pytest has inspired the development
of pytask in general. Without the excellent work of
[Holger Krekel](https://github.com/hpk42) and pytest's many contributors, this project
would not have been possible. Thank you!

pytask owes its beautiful appearance on the command line to

Repeating tasks in loops is inspired by [ward](https://github.com/darrenburns/ward)
