.. start-features

In its highest aspirations, pytask tries to be pytest as a build system. It's main
purpose is to facilitate reproducible research by automating workflows in research
projects. Its features include:

- **Automatic discovery of tasks.**

- **Lazy evaluation.** If a task, its dependencies, and its products have not changed,
  do not execute it.

- **Debug mode.** `Jump into the debugger
  <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_debug.html>`_ if a task
  fails, get feedback quickly, and be more productive.

- **Select tasks via expressions.** Run only a subset of tasks with `expressions and
  marker expressions
  <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_select_tasks.html>`_
  known from pytest.

- **Easily extensible with plugins**. pytask's architecture is based on `pluggy
  <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, a plugin management framework, so that
  you can adjust pytask to your needs. Plugins are, for example, available for
  `parallelization <https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-parallel>`_, `LaTeX
  <https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex>`_, `R
  <https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r>`_, and `Stata
  <https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata>`_. Read `here
  <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_use_plugins.html>`_ how
  you can use plugins.

Why do I need a build system?
-----------------------------

Read the `section in the documentation <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
explanations/why_do_i_need_a_build_system.html>`_ if you do not know or are not
convinced that you need a build system.


Installation
------------

.. start-installation

pytask is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pytask>`_ and on `Anaconda.org
<https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytask>`_. Install the package with

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pytask

    # or

    $ conda install -c conda-forge pytask

.. end-installation

Usage
-----

A task is a function which is detected if the module and the function name are prefixed
with ``task_``. Here is an example.

.. code-block:: python

    # Content of task_hello.py.

    import pytask


    @pytask.mark.produces("hello_earth.txt")
    def task_hello_earth(produces):
        produces.write_text("Hello, earth!")

Here are some details:

- Dependencies and products of a task are tracked via markers. For dependencies use
  ``@pytask.mark.depends_on`` and for products use ``@pytask.mark.produces``. Use
  strings and ``pathlib.Path`` to specify the location. Pass multiple dependencies or
  products as a list.
- With ``produces`` (and ``depends_on``) as function arguments, you get access to the
  dependencies and products inside the function via ``pathlib.Path`` objects. Here,
  ``produces`` holds the path to ``"hello_earth.txt"``.

To execute the task, type the following command on the command-line

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytask
    ========================= Start pytask session =========================
    Platform: linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytask 0.x.y, pluggy 0.x.y
    Root: xxx
    Collected 1 task(s).

    .
    ====================== 1 succeeded in 1 second(s) ======================


Demo
----

The demo walks you through the following steps.

1. Write an executable script which produces a text file like you would normally do
   without pytask.
2. Rewrite the script to a pytask task.
3. Execute the task.
4. Add a task which produces a second text file and another task which merges both text
   files.
5. Execute all three tasks.

Acknowledgment
--------------

The license also includes a copyright and permission notice from pytest since some
modules, classes, and functions are copied from pytest. Not to mention how pytest has
inspired the development pytask in general. Without the amazing work of Holger Krekel
and pytest's many contributors, this project would not have been possible. Thank you!
