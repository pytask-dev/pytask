Features
--------

In its highest aspirations, pytask tries to be pytest as a build system. Its features
include:

- **Automatic discovery of tasks.**

- **Lazy evaluation.** If a task or its dependencies have not changed, do not
  execute it.

- **Debug mode.** Jump into the debugger if a task fails and get quick feedback.

- **Select tasks via expressions.** Run only a subset of tasks with expressions and
  marker expressions known from pytest.

- **Easily extensible with plugins**. pytask's architecture is based on `pluggy
  <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, a plugin management and hook calling
  framework which enables you to adjust pytask to your needs.


Why do I need a build system?
-----------------------------

Read the `section in the documentation <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
explanations/why_do_i_need_a_build_system.html>`_ if you do not know or are not
convinced that you need a build system.


Installation
------------

pytask is available on `Anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/pytask/pytask>`_. Install the
package with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge --add channels pytask
    $ conda install pytask


Usage
-----

A task is a function which is detected if the module and the function name are prefixed
with ``task_``. Here is an example.

.. code-block:: python

    # Content of task_hello.py.

    import pytask


    @pytask.mark.produces("hello_earth.txt")
    def task_hello_earth(produces):
        produces.write_text("Hello, earth!")

Here are some details:

- Dependencies and products of a task are tracked via markers. For dependencies use
  ``@pytask.mark.depends_on`` and for products use ``@pytask.mark.produces``. Use
  strings and ``pathlib.Path`` to specify the location. Pass multiple dependencies or
  products as a list.
- With ``produces`` (and ``depends_on``) as function arguments, you get access to the
  dependencies and products inside the function via ``pathlib.Path`` objects. Here,
  ``produces`` holds the path to ``"hello_earth.txt"``.

To execute the task, type the following command on the command-line

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytask
    ========================= Start pytask session =========================
    Platform: linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytask 0.x.y, pluggy 0.x.y
    Root: xxx
    Collected 1 task(s).

    .
    ====================== 1 succeeded in 1 second(s) ======================


Demo
----

The demo walks you through the following steps.

1. Write an executable script which produces a text file like you would normally do
   without pytask.
2. Rewrite the script to a pytask task.
3. Execute the task.
4. Add a task which produces a second text file and another task which merges both text
   files.
5. Execute all three tasks.
