    Build system
        A build system is a tool for developing software which manages the process from
        compiling the source code to binary code, packaging the binary code and running
        tests.

        But, the same logic - managing tasks with multiple dependencies to get a product
        - applies to many areas including research projects.

    DAG
        A `directed acyclic graph (DAG) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
        Directed_acyclic_graph>`_  is a graph with a finite amount of vertices and edges
        which are connected such that no circles exist.
