    Build system
        A build system is a tool for developing software which manages the process from
        compiling the source code to binary code, packaging the binary code and running
        tests.

        But, the same logic - managing tasks with multiple dependencies to get a product
        - applies to many areas including research projects.

    DAG
        A `directed acyclic graph (DAG)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_  is a graph with a
        finite amount of vertices and edges which are connected such that no circles
        exist.
