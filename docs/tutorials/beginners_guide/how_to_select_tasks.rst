How to select tasks
===================

If you want to run only a subset of tasks, there exists currently one option.


Selecting tasks via paths
-------------------------

You can run all tasks in one file by passing the path to the file to pytask. The same
can be done for multiple paths

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytask path/to/task_1.py

    $ pytask path/to/task_1.py path/to/task_2.py
