This tutorial is for everyone who has some experience with `Waf <https://waf.io/>`_ as
used in the `econ-project-templates
<https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates>`_ by `Hans-Martin von
Gaudecker <https://github.com/hmgaudecker>`_.

The tutorial assumes that you already know to some extent what a :term:`build system
<Build system>` and a :term:`DAG` is and you do not have to be convinced that a build
system is the right approach. You will find this information in :ref:`beginners_guide`.

Here is the content of the tutorial.
