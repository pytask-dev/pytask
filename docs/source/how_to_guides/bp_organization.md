## How to contribute

Any contribution is highly appreciated. Feel free to continue a discussion in
[an existing issue](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask/issues) ticket or
[file a new ticket](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask/issues/new/choose) if, for
example, some of the following applies to you:

- You have a question regarding an existing guide or feel a guide needs clarification.
- You want to share your own experience with the suggestions provided in a guide.
- You want to extend the collection by providing another best-practices guide.

## Structure of guides

1. Each guide should start with a description of the scope of the guide. At best, guides
   deal with one thing only. If guides deal with higher-level topics, they should link
   to lower-level guides instead of trying to explain too much.
1. The second section is a TL;DR (too long; did not read) which provides a short summary
   of the guide and its (five) most important messages.
1. The third section, Best Practices, provides the advice in detail. This section must
   be well structured, concise, and easy to understand. Each tip is associated with an
   example.
