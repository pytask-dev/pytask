# Templates and projects

This document lists templates and projects which serve as examples of how to create a
research project.

## Templates

[cookiecutter-pytask-project](https://github.com/pytask-dev/cookiecutter-pytask-project)

: A simple skeleton for your next research project including many best-practices for
creating Python packages like support for pre-commit, Github Actions, etc..

[econ-project-templates](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates)

: This project aims to provide project templates for economists that make it easy to
produce reproducible research using one or more of the most frequently used programming
languages in economics (i.e Python, Stata, R, Matlab).

## Projects

[sid-germany](https://github.com/covid-19-impact-lab/sid-germany)

: A project about forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

  The project is especially interesting due to its scalable structure. Scenarios with
  different policies or behavioral mechanisms are implemented quickly. The extensive use
  of parametrizations lead to the automatic creation of many subsequent tasks per
  scenario.

[software_patents](https://github.com/tobiasraabe/software_patents)

: A simple research project which gives an overview how pytask can be used to setup a
research project.
