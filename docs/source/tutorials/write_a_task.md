# Write a task

Starting from the project structure in the {doc}`previous tutorial <set_up_a_project>`,
you will learn how to write your first task.

The task, `task_create_random_data`, will be defined in
`src/my_project/task_data_preparation.py`, and it will generate a data set stored in
`bld/data.pkl`.

The `task_` prefix for modules and task functions is important so that pytask
automatically discovers them.

```text
my_project
│
├───.pytask
│
├───bld
│   └────data.pkl
│
├───src
│   └───my_project
│       ├────__init__.py
│       ├────config.py
│       └────task_data_preparation.py
│
└───pyproject.toml
```

Generally, a task is a function whose name starts with `task_`. Tasks produce outputs
and the most common output is a file which we will focus on throughout the tutorials.

The following interfaces are different ways to specify the products of a task which is
necessary for pytask to correctly run a workflow. The interfaces are ordered from most
(left) to least recommended (right).

```{important}
You cannot mix different interfaces for the same task. Choose only one.
```

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python 3.10+

The task accepts the argument `path` that points to the file where the data set will be
stored. The path is passed to the task via the default value, `BLD / "data.pkl"`. To
indicate that this file is a product we add some metadata to the argument.

Look at the type hint `Annotated[Path, Product]`. It uses the
{obj}`~typing.Annotated` syntax. The first entry is the type of the argument,
{class}`~pathlib.Path`. The second entry is {class}`~pytask.Product` that marks this
argument as a product.

````{tab-item} produces

Tasks can use `produces` as an argument name. Every value, or in this case path, passed
to this argument is automatically treated as a task product. Here, the path is given by
the default value of the argument.

Now, execute pytask to collect tasks in the current and subsequent directories.

```{include} ../_static/md/write-a-task.md

## Customize task names

Use the {func}`@task <pytask.task>` decorator to mark a function as a task regardless of
its function name. You can optionally pass a new name for the task. Otherwise, pytask
uses the function name.

```python
from pytask import task

# The id will be ".../task_data_preparation.py::create_random_data".


@task
def create_random_data(): ...


# The id will be ".../task_data_preparation.py::create_data".


@task(name="create_data")
def create_random_data(): ...
```

## Customize task module names

Use the configuration value {confval}`task_files` if you prefer a different naming
scheme for the task modules. `task_*.py` is the default. You can specify one or multiple
patterns to collect tasks from other files.
