# Selecting tasks

If you want to run only a subset of tasks, there exist multiple options.

(markers)=

## Markers

If you assign markers to task functions, you can use marker expressions to select tasks.
For example, here is a task with the `wip` marker which indicates work-in-progress.

```python
@pytask.mark.wip
def task_1():
    pass
```

To execute only tasks with the `wip` marker, use

```console
$ pytask -m wip
```

You can pass more complex expressions to {option}`pytask build -m` by using multiple
markers and `and`, `or`, `not`, and `()`. The following pattern selects all tasks which
belong to the data management, but not the ones which produce plots and plots produced
for the analysis.

```console
$ pytask -m "(data_management and not plots) or (analysis and plots)"
```

If you create your own markers, use {confval}`markers` to register and document them.

(expressions)=

## Expressions

Expressions are similar to markers and offer the same syntax but target the task ids
with {option}`pytask build -k`. Assume you have the following tasks.

```python
def task_1():
    pass


def task_2():
    pass


def task_12():
    pass
```

Then,

```console
$ pytask -k 1
```

will execute the first and third task and

```console
$ pytask -k "1 and not 2"
```

executes only the first task.

```console
$ pytask -k "1 or 2 and not 12"
```

executes the first two tasks.

To execute a single task, say `task_run_this_one` in `task_example.py`, use

```console
$ pytask -k task_example.py::task_run_this_one

# or

$ pytask -k task_run_this_one
```

### Selecting repeated tasks

If you have a parametrized task, you can select individual parametrizations.

```python
for i in range(2):

    @pytask.mark.task
    def task_parametrized(i=i):
        ...
```

To run the task where `i = 1`, type

```console
$ pytask -k task_parametrized[1]
```

Booleans, floats, integers, and strings are used in the task id as they are, but all
other Python objects like tuples are replaced with a combination of the argument name
and an iteration counter. Multiple arguments are separated via dashes.
