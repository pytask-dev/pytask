How to set up a project
=======================

This tutorial shows you how to set up your project.


The directory structure
-----------------------

The following directory tree is an example of how a project can be set up.

.. code-block::

    my_project
    ├───pytask.ini or tox.ini or setup.cfg
    │
    ├───src
    │   ├────config.py
    │   └────...
    │
    └───bld
        └────...

- The configuration file, ``pytask.ini``, ``tox.ini`` or ``setup.cfg``, should be placed
  at the root of the project folder and should contain a ``[pytask]`` section which can
  be left empty.

  .. code-block:: ini

      # Content of pytask.ini, tox.ini or setup.cfg.

      [pytask]

  The file in combination with the section will indicate the root of the project. This
  has two benefits.

  1. pytask needs to save some data across executions. It will store this information in
     a ``.pytask.sqlite3`` database in the root folder.

  2. Even if you start pytask from a different location inside the project folder than
     the root, the database will be found and pytask runs as if it is run in the project
     root.

- The ``src`` directory contains the tasks and source files of the project.

  It also contains a ``config.py`` or a similar module to store the configuration of the
  project. For example, you should define paths pointing to the source and build
  directory of the project.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Content of config.py.

      from pathlib import Path


      SRC = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
      BLD = SRC.joinpath("..", "bld").resolve()

- The build directory ``bld`` is used to store products of tasks. The separation between
  a source and build directory makes it easy to start from a clean project by deleting
  the build directory.


setup.py
--------

The ``setup.py`` is useful to turn the source directory into a Python package. It allows
to perform imports from ``src``. E.g., ``from src.config import SRC``.

Here is the content of the file.

.. code-block:: python

    # Content of setup.py

    from setuptools import setup


    setup(name="my_project", version="0.0.1")

Then, install the package into your environment with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda develop .

    # or

    $ pip install -e .

Both commands will produce an editable install of the project which means any changes in
the source files of the package are reflected in the installed version of the package.

.. tip::

    Do not forget to rerun the editable install every time you recreate your Python
    environment.
