# Set up a project

This tutorial shows you how to set up your first project.

:::{seealso}
If you want to start from a template or take inspiration from previous projects, look at
{doc}`../how_to_guides/bp_templates_and_projects`.
:::

## The directory structure

The following directory tree is an example of how a project can be set up.

```
my_project
├───pytask.ini or tox.ini or setup.cfg
│
├───src
│   └───my_project
│       ├────config.py
│       └────...
│
├───setup.cfg
│
├───pyproject.toml
│
├───.pytask.sqlite3
│
└───bld
    └────...
```

### The configuration

The configuration resides in either a `pytask.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg` file. The
file is placed in the root folder of the project and contains a `[pytask]` section which
can be left empty. Here, we set `paths` such that it points to the project.

```ini
# Content of pytask.ini, tox.ini or setup.cfg.

[pytask]
paths = ./src/my_project
```

The file in combination with an empty section will signal the root of the project to
pytask. This has two benefits.

1. pytask needs to save some data across executions. It will store this information in a
   `.pytask.sqlite3` database in the root folder.
1. If you start pytask without a path - simply `pytask` - from a different location
   inside the project folder than the root, the database will be found and pytask runs
   as if it is run in the project root.

### The source directory

The `src` directory is empty except for a folder containing the tasks and source files
of the project. The nested structure is called the src layout and the preferred way to
structure Python packages.

You find a better explanation of the src layout in [this article by Hynek
Schlawack](https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/).
:::

It also contains a `config.py` or a similar module to store the configuration of the
project. For example, you should define paths pointing to the source and build directory
of the project.

```python
# Content of config.py.

from pathlib import Path


SRC = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
BLD = SRC.joinpath("..", "..", "bld").resolve()
```

### The build directory

The build directory `bld` is created automatically during the execution. It is used to
store the products of tasks and can be deleted to rebuild the entire project.

### Install the project

Two files are necessary to turn the source directory into a Python package. It allows to
perform imports from `my_project`. E.g., `from my_project.config import SRC`. We also
need `pip >= 21.1`.

First, we need a `setup.cfg` which contains the name and version of the package and
where the source code can be found.

```ini
# Content of setup.cfg

[metadata]
name = my_project
version = 0.0.1

[options]
packages = find:
package_dir =
    =src

[options.packages.find]
where = src
```

Secondly, you need a `pyproject.toml` with this content:

```toml
# Content of pyproject.toml

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

:::{seealso}
You find this and more information in the documentation for
[setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html).
:::

Now, you can install the package into your environment with

```console
$ pip install -e .
```

This command will trigger an editable install of the project which means any changes in
the source files of the package are immediately reflected in the installed version of
the package.

:::{important}
Do not forget to rerun the editable install should you recreate your Python environment.

:::{tip}
For a more sophisticated setup where versions are managed via tags on the repository,
check out [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm). The tool is also
used in
[cookiecutter-pytask-project](https://github.com/pytask-dev/cookiecutter-pytask-project).
