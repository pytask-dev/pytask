# Making tasks persist

Sometimes you want to skip the execution of a task and pretend like nothing has changed.

A common scenario is that you have a long running task which will be executed again if
you would format the task's source file with [black](https://github.com/psf/black).

In this case, you can apply the {func}`@pytask.mark.persist <pytask.mark.persist>`
decorator to the task which will skip its execution as long as all products exist.

Internally, the state of the dependencies, the source file and the products is updated
in the database such that the next execution will skip the task successfully.

## When is this useful?

- You ran a formatter like Black on the files in your project and want to prevent the
  longest running tasks from being rerun.
- You extend a repetition of a task function, but do not want to rerun all tasks.
- You want to integrate a task which you have already run elsewhere. Place the
  dependencies and products and the task definition in the correct place and make the
  task persist.

:::{caution}
This feature can corrupt the integrity of your project. Document why you have applied
the decorator out of consideration for yourself and other contributors.

## How to do it?

To create a persisting task, apply the correct decorator and, et voil√†, it is done.

To see the whole process, first, we create some task and its dependency.

```python
# Content of task_module.py

import pytask


@pytask.mark.persist
@pytask.mark.depends_on("input.md")
@pytask.mark.produces("output.md")
def task_make_input_bold(depends_on, produces):
    produces.write_text("**" + depends_on.read_text() + "**")
```

```md
<!-- Content of input.md. -->

Here is the text.
```

If you execute the task with pytask, the task will be executed since the product is
missing.

```{image} /_static/images/persist-executed.svg
```

After that, we change the source file of the task accidentally by formatting the file
with black. Without the {func}`@pytask.mark.persist <pytask.mark.persist>` decorator the
task would run again since it has changed. With the decorator, the execution is skipped
which is signaled by a green p.

```{image} /_static/images/persist-persisted.svg
```

If we now run the task again, it is skipped because nothing has changed and not because
it is marked with {func}`@pytask.mark.persist <pytask.mark.persist>`.
