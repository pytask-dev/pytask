# Defining dependencies and products

To ensure pytask executes all tasks in the correct order, you need to define
dependencies and products for each task.

This tutorial offers you different interfaces. If you are comfortable with type
annotations or not afraid to try them, take a look at the tabs named `Python 3.10+` or
`Python 3.8+`.

If you want to avoid type annotations for now, look at the tab named `produces`.

The deprecated approaches can be found in the tabs named `Decorators`.

```{seealso}
An overview on the different interfaces and their strength and weaknesses is given in
{doc}`../explanations/interfaces_for_dependencies_products`.
```

First, we focus on how to define products which should already be familiar to you. Then,
we focus on how task dependencies can be declared.

We use the same project layout as before and add a `task_plot_data.py` module.

## Products

Let's revisit the task from the {doc}`previous tutorial <write_a_task>` that we defined
in `task_data_preparation.py`.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_py310.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

{class}`~pytask.Product` allows to declare an argument as a product. After the
task has finished, pytask will check whether the file exists.

:::

:::{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_py38.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

Using {class}`~pytask.Product` allows to declare an argument as a product. After the
task has finished, pytask will check whether the file exists.

:::

:::{tab-item} &#8203;`produces`
:sync: produces

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_produces.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

Tasks can use `produces` as an "magic" argument name. Every value, or in this case path,
passed to this argument is automatically treated as a task product. Here, the path is
given by the default value of the argument.

:::

:::{tab-item} Decorators
:sync: decorators

```{warning}
This approach is deprecated and will be removed in v0.5
```

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_decorators.py
:emphasize-lines: 9, 10
```

The {func}`@pytask.mark.produces <pytask.mark.produces>` marker attaches a product to a
task which is a {class}`pathlib.Path` to file. After the task has finished, pytask will
check whether the file exists.

Add `produces` as an argument of the task function to get access to the same path inside
the task function.

If you do not know about {mod}`pathlib` check out [^id3] and [^id4]. The module is
beneficial for handling paths conveniently and across platforms.

## Dependencies

Most tasks have dependencies and it is important to specify. Then, pytask ensures that
the dependencies are available before executing the task.

As an example, we want to extend our project with another task that plots the data that
we generated with `task_create_random_data`. The task is called `task_plot_data` and we
will define it in `task_plot_data.py`.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

To specify that the task relies on the data set `data.pkl`, you can simply add the path
to the function signature while choosing any argument name, here `path_to_data`.

pytask assumes that all function arguments that do not have the {class}`~pytask.Product`
annotation are dependencies of the task.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_py310.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

To specify that the task relies on the data set `data.pkl`, you can simply add the path
to the function signature while choosing any argument name, here `path_to_data`.

pytask assumes that all function arguments that do not have the {class}`~pytask.Product`
annotation are dependencies of the task.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_py38.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

:::

:::{tab-item} &#8203;`produces`
:sync: produces

To specify that the task relies on the data set `data.pkl`, you can simply add the path
to the function signature while choosing any argument name, here `path_to_data`.

pytask assumes that all function arguments that are not passed to the argument
`produces` are dependencies of the task.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_produces.py
:emphasize-lines: 9
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Decorators
:sync: decorators

```{warning}
This approach is deprecated and will be removed in v0.5
```

Equivalent to products, you can use the
{func}`@pytask.mark.depends_on <pytask.mark.depends_on>` decorator to specify that
`data.pkl` is a dependency of the task. Use `depends_on` as a function argument to
access the dependency path inside the function and load the data.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_decorators.py
:emphasize-lines: 9, 11
```

:::

Now, let us execute the two paths.

```{include} ../_static/md/defining-dependencies-products.md
```

## Relative paths

Dependencies and products do not have to be absolute paths. If paths are relative, they
are assumed to point to a location relative to the task module.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_py310.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_py38.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

:::

:::{tab-item} &#8203;`produces`
:sync: produces

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_produces.py
:emphasize-lines: 4
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Decorators
:sync: decorators

```{warning}
This approach is deprecated and will be removed in v0.5
```

You can also use absolute and relative paths as strings that obey the same rules as the
{class}`pathlib.Path`.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_decorators.py
:emphasize-lines: 6
```

If you use `depends_on` or `produces` as arguments for the task function, you will have
access to the paths of the targets as {class}`pathlib.Path`.

## Multiple dependencies and products

Of course, tasks can have multiple dependencies and products.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple1_py310.py
```

You can group your dependencies and product if you prefer not having a function argument
per input. Use dictionaries (recommended), tuples, lists, or more nested structures if
you need.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple2_py310.py
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple1_py38.py
```

You can group your dependencies and product if you prefer not having a function argument
per input. Use dictionaries (recommended), tuples, lists, or more nested structures if
you need.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple2_py38.py
```

:::

:::{tab-item} &#8203;`produces`
:sync: produces

If your task has multiple products, group them in one container like a dictionary
(recommended), tuples, lists or a more nested structures.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple1_produces.py
```

You can do the same with dependencies.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple2_produces.py
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Decorators
:sync: decorators

```{warning}
This approach is deprecated and will be removed in v0.5
```

The easiest way to attach multiple dependencies or products to a task is to pass a
{class}`dict` (highly recommended), {class}`list`, or another iterator to the marker
containing the paths.

To assign labels to dependencies or products, pass a dictionary. For example,

```python
from typing import Dict


@pytask.mark.produces({"first": BLD / "data_0.pkl", "second": BLD / "data_1.pkl"})
def task_create_random_data(produces: Dict[str, Path]) -> None:
    ...
```

Then, use `produces` inside the task function.

```pycon
>>> produces["first"]
BLD / "data_0.pkl"

>>> produces["second"]
BLD / "data_1.pkl"
```

You can also use lists and other iterables.

```python
@pytask.mark.produces([BLD / "data_0.pkl", BLD / "data_1.pkl"])
def task_create_random_data(produces):
    ...
```

Inside the function, the arguments `depends_on` or `produces` become a dictionary where
keys are the positions in the list.

```pycon
>>> produces
{0: BLD / "data_0.pkl", 1: BLD / "data_1.pkl"}
```

Why does pytask recommend dictionaries and convert lists, tuples, or other
iterators to dictionaries? First, dictionaries with positions as keys behave very
similarly to lists.

Secondly, dictionaries use keys instead of positions that are more verbose and
descriptive and do not assume a fixed ordering. Both attributes are especially desirable
in complex projects.

**Multiple decorators**

pytask merges multiple decorators of one kind into a single dictionary. This might help
you to group dependencies and apply them to multiple tasks.

```python
common_dependencies = pytask.mark.depends_on(
    {"first_text": "text_1.txt", "second_text": "text_2.txt"}
)


@common_dependencies
@pytask.mark.depends_on("text_3.txt")
def task_example(depends_on):
    ...
```

Inside the task, `depends_on` will be

```pycon
>>> depends_on
{"first_text": ... / "text_1.txt", "second_text": "text_2.txt", 0: "text_3.txt"}
```

**Nested dependencies and products**

Dependencies and products can be nested containers consisting of tuples, lists, and
dictionaries. It is beneficial if you want more structure and nesting.

Here is an example of a task that fits some model on data. It depends on a module
containing the code for the model, which is not actively used but ensures that the task
is rerun when the model is changed. And it depends on the data.

```python
@pytask.mark.depends_on(
    {
        "model": [SRC / "models" / "model.py"],
        "data": {"a": SRC / "data" / "a.pkl", "b": SRC / "data" / "b.pkl"},
    }
)
@pytask.mark.produces(BLD / "models" / "fitted_model.pkl")
def task_fit_model(depends_on, produces):
    ...
```

`depends_on` within the function will be

```python
{
    "model": [SRC / "models" / "model.py"],
    "data": {"a": SRC / "data" / "a.pkl", "b": SRC / "data" / "b.pkl"},
}
```

## Depending on a task

In some situations you want to define a task depending on another task without
specifying the relationship explicitly.

pytask allows you to do that, but you loose features like access to paths which is why
defining dependencies explicitly is always preferred.

There are two modes for it and both use {func}`@task(after=...) <pytask.task>`.

First, you can pass the task function or multiple task functions to the decorator.
Applied to the tasks from before, we could have written `task_plot_data` as

```python
@task(after=task_create_random_data)
def task_plot_data(...):
    ...
```

You can also pass a list of task functions.

The second mode is to pass an expression, a substring of the name of the dependent
tasks. Here, we can pass the function name or a significant part of the function
name.

```python
@task(after="random_data")
def task_plot_data(...):
    ...
```

You will learn more about expressions in {doc}`selecting_tasks`.
