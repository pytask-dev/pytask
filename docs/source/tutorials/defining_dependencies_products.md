# Defining dependencies and products

Tasks have dependencies and products that you must define to run your tasks.

Defining dependencies and products also serves another purpose. By analyzing them,
pytask determines the order to run the tasks.

This tutorial offers you different interfaces. If you are comfortable with type
annotations or are not afraid to try them, look at the `Python 3.10+` or `3.8+` tabs.
You find a tutorial on type hints {doc}`here <../type_hints>`.

If you want to avoid type annotations for now, look at the tab named `produces`.

```{seealso}
In this tutorial, we only deal with local files. If you want to use pytask with files
online, S3, GCP, Azure, etc., read the
{doc}`guide on remote files <../how_to_guides/remote_files>`.
```

First, we focus on defining products that should already be familiar to you. Then, we
focus on how you can declare task dependencies.

We use the same project as before and add a `task_plot_data.py` module.

## Products

Let's revisit the task from the {doc}`previous tutorial <write_a_task>` that we defined
in `task_data_preparation.py`.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_py310.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

{class}`~pytask.Product` allows marking an argument as a product. After the
task has finished, pytask will check whether the file exists.

````

````{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_py38.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

{class}`~pytask.Product` allows marking an argument as a product. After the
task has finished, pytask will check whether the file exists.

````

````{tab-item} produces
:sync: produces

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_products_produces.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

Tasks can use `produces` as a "magic" argument name. Every value, or in this case path,
passed to this argument is automatically treated as a task product. Here, we pass the
path as the default argument.

```{tip}
If you do not know about {mod}`pathlib` check out this guide by
[RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/). The module is beneficial for
handling paths conveniently and across platforms.
```

## Dependencies

Adding a dependency to a task ensures that the dependency is available before execution.

To show how dependencies work, we extend our project with another task that plots the
data generated with `task_create_random_data`. The task is called `task_plot_data`, and
we will define it in `task_plot_data.py`.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

To specify that the task relies on the data set `data.pkl`, you can add the path
to the function signature while choosing any argument name, here `path_to_data`.

pytask assumes that all function arguments that do not have a {class}`~pytask.Product`
annotation are dependencies of the task.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_py310.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

````

````{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

To specify that the task relies on the data set `data.pkl`, you can add the path
to the function signature while choosing any argument name, here `path_to_data`.

pytask assumes that all function arguments that do not have the {class}`~pytask.Product`
annotation are dependencies of the task.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_py38.py
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

````

````{tab-item} produces
:sync: produces

To specify that the task relies on the data set `data.pkl`, you can add the path to the
function signature while choosing any argument name, here `path_to_data`.

pytask assumes that all function arguments that are not passed to the argument
`produces` are dependencies of the task.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_dependencies_produces.py
:emphasize-lines: 9
```

````
`````

Now, let us execute the two paths.

```{include} ../_static/md/defining-dependencies-products.md
```

## Relative paths

Dependencies and products do not have to be absolute paths. If paths are relative, they
are assumed to point to a location relative to the task module.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_py310.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

````

````{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_py38.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

````

````{tab-item} produces
:sync: produces

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_relative_produces.py
:emphasize-lines: 4
```

````
`````

## Multiple dependencies and products

Of course, tasks can have multiple dependencies and products.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python 3.10+
:sync: python310plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple1_py310.py
```

You can group your dependencies and product if you prefer not to have a function
argument per input. Use dictionaries (recommended), tuples, lists, or more nested
structures if needed.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple2_py310.py
```

````

````{tab-item} Python 3.8+
:sync: python38plus

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple1_py38.py
```

You can group your dependencies and product if you prefer not to have a function
argument per input. Use dictionaries (recommended), tuples, lists, or more nested
structures if needed.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple2_py38.py
```

````

````{tab-item} produces
:sync: produces

If your task has multiple products, group them in one container like a dictionary
(recommended), tuples, lists, or more nested structures.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple1_produces.py
```

You can do the same with dependencies.

```{literalinclude} ../../../docs_src/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products_multiple2_produces.py
```

## Depending on a task

In some situations, you want to define a task depending on another task.

pytask allows you to do that, but you lose features like access to paths, which is why
defining dependencies explicitly is always preferred.

There are two modes for it, and both use {func}`@task(after=...) <pytask.task>`.

First, you can pass the task function or multiple task functions to the decorator.
Applied to the tasks from before, we could have written `task_plot_data` as

```python
@task(after=task_create_random_data)
def task_plot_data(...):
    ...
```

You can also pass a list of task functions.

The second mode is to pass an expression, a substring of the name of the dependent
tasks. Here, we can pass the function name or a significant part of the function name.

```python
@task(after="random_data")
def task_plot_data(...):
    ...
```

You will learn more about expressions in {doc}`selecting_tasks`.

## Further reading

- There is an additional way to specify products by treating the returns of a task
  function as a product. Read {doc}`../how_to_guides/using_task_returns` to learn more
  about it.
- An overview of all ways to specify dependencies and products and their strengths and
  weaknesses can be found in
  {doc}`../how_to_guides/interfaces_for_dependencies_products`.
