# Capturing output

What is capturing? Some of your tasks may use {func}`print` statements, have progress
bars, require user input or the libraries you are using show information during
execution.

Since the output would pollute the terminal and the information shown by pytask, it
captures all the output during execution and attaches it to the report of this task by
default.

If the task fails, the output is shown along with the traceback to help you track down
the error.

## Default stdout/stderr/stdin capturing behavior

During task execution any output sent to `stdout` and `stderr` is captured. If a task
fails its captured output will usually be shown along with the failure traceback.

In addition, `stdin` is set to a "null" object which will fail on attempts to read from
it because it is rarely desired to wait for interactive input when running automated
tasks.

By default capturing is done by intercepting writes to low level file descriptors. This
allows to capture output from simple {func}`print` statements as well as output from a
subprocess started by a task.

## Setting capturing methods or disabling capturing

There are three ways in which `pytask` can perform capturing:

- `fd` (file descriptor) level capturing (default): All writes going to the operating
  system file descriptors 1 and 2 will be captured.
- `sys` level capturing: Only writes to Python files {class}`sys.stdout` and
  {class}`sys.stderr` will be captured. No capturing of writes to file descriptors is
  performed.
- `tee-sys` capturing: Python writes to {class}`sys.stdout` and {class}`sys.stderr` will
  be captured, however the writes will also be passed-through to the actual
  {class}`sys.stdout` and {class}`sys.stderr`.

You can influence output capturing mechanisms from the command line:

```console
$ pytask -s                  # disable all capturing
$ pytask --capture=sys       # replace sys.stdout/stderr with in-mem files
$ pytask --capture=fd        # also point filedescriptors 1 and 2 to temp file
$ pytask --capture=tee-sys   # combines 'sys' and '-s', capturing sys.stdout/stderr
                             # and passing it along to the actual sys.stdout/stderr
```

## Using print statements for debugging

One primary benefit of the default capturing of stdout/stderr output is that you can use
print statements for debugging:

```python
# content of task_capture.py


def task_func1():
    assert True


def task_func2():
    print("Debug statement")
    assert False
```

and running this module will show you precisely the output of the failing function and
hide the other one:
