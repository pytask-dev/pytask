# Type hints

Python has support for type hints (or type annotations) that allow users to provide
information on the type of variables.

Type hints can be used

- by editors to provide better introspection into objects.
- by tools like mypy that check your code given the variable types.
- as additional documentation.

pytask uses type hints as part of its interface.

If you want to refresh your knowledge about type hints, follow
[this guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types) from FastAPI's documentation
that teaches you everything you need to know. (You can ignore the section about
pydantic.)
