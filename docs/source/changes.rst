Changes
=======

This is a record of all past pytask releases and what went into them in reverse
chronological order. Releases follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ and
all releases are available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pytask>`_ and
`Anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytask>`_.


0.1.4 - 2021-xx-xx
------------------

- :gh:`159` removes files for creating a conda package which is handled by conda-forge.
- :gh:`161` removes a workaround for pyreadline which is also removed in pytest 7.
- :gh:`163` allow forward slashes in expressions and marker expressions.


0.1.3 - 2021-11-30
------------------

- :gh:`157` adds packaging to the dependencies of the package.
- :gh:`158` converts time units to the nearest integer.


0.1.2 - 2021-11-27
------------------

- :gh:`135` implements handling of version in docs as proposed by setuptools-scm.
- :gh:`142` removes the display of skipped and persisted tasks from the live execution
  table for the default verbosity level of 1. They are displayed at 2.
- :gh:`144` adds tryceratops to the pre-commit hooks for catching issues with
  exceptions.
- :gh:`150` adds a limit on the number of items displayed in the execution table which
  is also configurable with ``--n-entries-in-table`` on the cli and
  ``n_entries_in_table`` in the configuration file.
- :gh:`152` makes the duration of the execution readable by humans by separating it into
  days, hours, minutes and seconds.
- :gh:`155` implements functions to check for optional packages and programs and raises
  errors for requirements to draw the DAG earlier.
- :gh:`156` adds an option to print/show errors as soon as they occur.


0.1.1 - 2021-08-25
------------------

- :gh:`138` changes the default verbosity to ``1`` which displays the live table during
  execution and ``0`` display the symbols for outcomes (e.g. ``.``, ``F``, ``s``).
- :gh:`139` enables rich's auto-refresh mechanism for live objects which causes almost
  no performance penalty for the live table compared to the symbolic output.


0.1.0 - 2021-07-20
------------------

- :gh:`106` implements a verbose mode for the execution which is available with ``pytask
  -v`` and shows a table with running and completed tasks. It also refines the
  collection status.
- :gh:`116`, :gh:`117`, and :gh:`123` fix :gh:`104` which prevented to skip tasks with
  missing dependencies.
- :gh:`118` makes the path to the configuration in the session header os-specific.
- :gh:`119` changes that when marker or keyword expressions are used to select tasks,
  also the predecessors of the selected tasks will be executed.
- :gh:`120` implements that a single ``KeyboardInterrupt`` stops the execution and
  previously collected reports are shown.
- :gh:`121` add skipped and persisted tasks to the execution footer.
- :gh:`127` make the table during execution the default. Silence pytask with negative
  verbose mode integers and increase verbosity with positive ones.
- :gh:`129` allows to hide frames from the traceback by using ``__tracebackhide__ =
  True``.
- :gh:`130` enables rendering of tracebacks from subprocesses with rich.


0.0.16 - 2021-06-25
-------------------

- :gh:`111` fixes error when using ``pytask --version`` with click v8.


0.0.15 - 2021-06-24
-------------------

- :gh:`80` replaces some remaining formatting using ``pprint`` with ``rich``.
- :gh:`81` adds a warning if a path is not correctly cased on a case-insensitive file
  system. This facilitates cross-platform builds of projects. Deactivate the check by
  setting ``check_casing_of_paths = false`` in the configuration file.
- :gh:`83` replaces ``versioneer`` with ``setuptools_scm``.
- :gh:`84` fixes an error in the path normalization introduced by :gh:`81`.
- :gh:`85` sorts collected tasks, dependencies, and products by name.
- :gh:`87` fixes that dirty versions are displayed in the documentation.
- :gh:`88` adds a ``profile`` command to show information on tasks like duration and
  file size of products.
- :gh:`93` fixes the display of parametrized arguments in the console.
- :gh:`94` adds ``--show-locals`` which allows to print local variables in tracebacks.
- :gh:`96` implements a spinner to show the progress during the collection.
- :gh:`99` enables color support in WSL and fixes ``show_locals`` during collection.
- :gh:`101` implement to visualize the project's DAG. :gh:`108` refines the
  implementation.
- :gh:`102` adds an example if a parametrization provides not the number of arguments
  specified in the signature.
- :gh:`105` simplifies the logging of the tasks.
- :gh:`107` adds and new hook ``pytask_unconfigure`` which makes pytask return
  :func:`pdb.set_trace` at the end of a session which allows to use ``breakpoint()``
  inside test functions using pytask.
- :gh:`109` makes pytask require networkx>=2.4 since previous versions fail with Python
  3.9.
- :gh:`110` adds a "New Features" section to the ``README.rst``.


0.0.14 - 2021-03-23
-------------------

- :gh:`74` reworks the formatting of the command line output by using ``rich``. Due to
  the new dependency, support for pytask with Python <3.6.1 on PyPI and with Python <3.7
  on Anaconda will end.
- :gh:`76` fixes :gh:`75` which reports a bug when a closest ancestor cannot be found to
  shorten node names in the CLI output. Instead a common ancestor is used.

-------------------

- :gh:`72` adds conda-forge to the README and highlights importance of specifying
  dependencies and products.
