## Features

<!-- Keep in sync with README.md -->

pytask is a workflow management system that facilitates reproducible data analyses. Its
features include:

- **Automatic discovery of tasks.**
- **Lazy evaluation.** If a task, its dependencies, and its products have not changed,
  do not execute it.
- **Debug mode.**
  [Jump into the debugger](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/debugging.html)
  if a task fails, get feedback quickly, and be more productive.
- **Repeat a task with different inputs.**
  [Loop over task functions](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/repeating_tasks_with_different_inputs.html)
  to run the same task with different inputs.
- **Select tasks via expressions.** Run only a subset of tasks with
  [expressions and marker expressions](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/selecting_tasks.html).
- **Easily extensible with plugins**. pytask is built on top of
  [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a plugin management framework,
  which allows you to adjust pytask to your needs. Plugins are available for
  [parallelization](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-parallel),
  [LaTeX](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex),
  [R](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r), and
  [Stata](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata), and more can be found
  [here](https://github.com/topics/pytask). Learn more about plugins in
  [this tutorial](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/plugins.html).

To get started with pytask, the documentation includes a series of tutorials. Go to the
