    - On case-sensitive POSIX systems, :meth:`pathlib.Path.exists` fails with a
      case-insensitive path.
    - On case-insensitive POSIX systems, :meth:`pathlib.Path.exists` succeeds with a

    - On case-insensitive POSIX systems, :meth:`pathlib.Path.resolve` does not return
      a case-sensitive path which it does on Windows.
